# Conditional Statements in Java

This folder has programs that show how to make decisions in Java.
#  What are Conditional Statements?
Conditional statements allow programs to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. 

# Key aspects of conditional statements:
Conditions:
These are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. They are often comparisons using operators like ==, >, <, !=, etc. 
Execution Flow:
Based on the condition's outcome, the program executes a specific block of code. If the condition is true, one block runs; if false, another (or none) runs. 

For example:
- If it is raining, take an umbrella.
- If a number is even, print "Even".
- If a student gets 90 marks, give "A grade".

These decisions are made using conditional statements.

#  Types of Conditional Statements

1. **if** – Do something only when a condition is true.

2. **if-else** – Do one thing if the condition is true, or something else if it is false.

3. **if - else if - else** – Check many conditions one after another.

4. **nested if** – An `if` statement inside another `if`.

5. **switch** – Choose what to do from many options based on one value (like day of the week).

This folder contains programs that:
- Check if a number is even or odd  
- Find grades based on marks  
- Show the day of the week

# Summary

Conditional statements help the program make smart choices.  
They are used in almost every Java program to control what happens next.
